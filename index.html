   <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
   <p><em>The chapter is focused on the data mining aspect of the applications of rough set theory.
Consequently, the theoretical part is minimized to emphasize the practical application
side of the rough set approach in the context of data analysis and model-building
applications. Initially, the original rough set approach is presented and illustrated
with detailed examples showing how data can be analyzed with this approach. The next
section illustrates the Variable Precision Rough Set Model (VPRSM) to expose
similarities and differences between these two approaches. Then, the data mining
system LERS, based on a different generalization of the original rough set theory than
VPRSM, is presented. Brief descriptions of algorithms are also cited. Finally, some
applications of the LERS data mining system are listed.</em></p>

        <h3> INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Discovering useful models capturing regularities of natural phenomena or complex
systems was, until recently, almost entirely limited to finding formulas fitting empirical
data. This worked relatively well in physics, theoretical mechanics, and other classical
and fundamental areas of Science and Engineering. However, in social sciences, market
research, medical area, pharmacy, molecular biology, learning and perception in biology,
and in many other areas, the complexities of the natural processes and their common lack
of analytical “smoothness” almost totally exclude the possibility of using standardmathematical tools for the purpose of data-based modeling. To serve the modeling needs
of all these areas, a fundamentally different approach is needed. The availability of fast
data processors creates new possibilities in that respect. To take advantage of the
possibilities, new mathematical theories oriented towards creating and manipulating
empirical functions and relations need to be developed. In fact, this need for alternative
approaches to modeling from data was recognized some time ago by researchers working
in the areas of neural nets, inductive learning, rough sets, and, more recently, in the area
of data mining. The models, in the form of data-based structures of decision tables or
rules, play a similar role to formulas in classical analytical modeling. Such theories can
be analyzed, interpreted, and optimized using the methods of rough set theory.
 In this chapter, we are assuming that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of
set theory and probability theory.

                       <h4>General Overview of Rough Set Theory</h4>
    <p>The theory of rough sets (RST) was originated by Pawlak in 1982 as a formal
mathematical theory, modeling knowledge about the domain of interest in terms of a
collection of equivalence relations (Pawlak, 1982). Its main application area is in
acquisition, analysis, and optimization of computer-processible models from data. The
models can represent functional, partial functional, and probabilistic relations existing
in data in the extended rough set approaches (Katzberg & Ziarko, 1996; Ziarko, 1993,
1999). The main advantage of rough set theory is that it does not need any preliminary
or additional information about data (like probability in probability theory, grade of
membership in fuzzy set theory, etc.) (Grzymala-Busse, 1988).
    </p>
    
        <em>The Original Rough Set Model</em>
    <p>The original rough set model is concerned with investigating the properties and the
limitations of knowledge with respect to being able to form discriminative descriptions
of subsets of the domain. The model is also used to investigate and prove numerous
useful algebraic and logical properties of the knowledge and approximately defined sets,
called rough sets. The inclusion of the approximately defined sets in the rough set model
is a consequence of the knowledge imperfections in practical situations. In general, only
an approximate description of a set can be formed. The approximate description consists
of definitions of lower approximation and upper approximation. The approximations are
definable sets, that is, having a discriminative description. The upper approximation is
the smallest definable set containing the target set. The lower approximation is the largest
definable set included in the target set. This ability to create approximations of nondefinable, or rough, sets allows for development of approximate classification algorithms
for prediction, machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, etc. In these algorithms, the problem of classifying an observation into an indefinable category, which is
not tractable in the sense that the discriminating description of the category does not
exist, is replaced by the problem of classifying the observation into a definable approximation of the category that is tractable. If the approximations are “tight” enough, then
the likelihood of an error of decisionmaking or prediction based on such an approximate
classifier is minimal.</p>
    
    
        <em> Variable Precision Rough Set Model (VPRSM)</em>
        <p>
       The original rough set theory has been applied with success to a number of
classification-related problems in control, medicine, machine learning, data mining, etc.
(see, for example, Polkowski & Skowron, 1998). However, developing practical applications also revealed the limitations of this approach. The most serious one was related
to the observation that often, when dealing with empirical data such as market survey
data, it was not possible to identify non-empty lower approximation of the target
category, for example, of the category of buyers of a service or product. Similarly, it was
often not possible to identify non-trivial upper approximation of the target category,
which do not extend over the whole domain. These limitations are the natural consequence of the fact that the classification problems are often inherently non-deterministic.
This means that the available information does not permit for error-free, deterministic
classification, even on a subset of the domain. For example, one can never 100% correctly
predict the buying behavior of a customer based on typical market survey results.
Consequently, the desire to make rough set model applicable to larger class of
practical problems leads to the development of a generalized model of rough sets referred
to as variable precision rough set model (VPRSM) (Ziarko, 1993). As in the original rough
set model, set approximations are also formed in VPRSM. However, the criteria for
forming the lower and upper approximations are relaxed, in particular allowing a controlled degree of misclassification in the lower approximation. The resulting lower
approximation represents an area of the domain where the correct classification can be
made with the desired probability of success, rather than deterministically. In this way,
the VPRSM approach can handle large class of problems that require developing nondeterministic predictive models from data. VPRSM preserves all basic properties and
algorithms of the original rough sets. In particular, the basic algorithms for decision table
analysis, optimization, and decision rules acquisition are directly inherited by VPRSM
from the original rough set model (Pawlak, 1991). In VPRSM, they are additionally
enhanced with the frequency distribution or probabilistic information acquired from data
(Katzberg & Ziarko, 1996; Ziarko, 1999). As a result, the classifier systems developed
within the framework of VPRSM have probabilistic confidence factors associated with
them to reflect the degree of uncertainty in classificatory decisionmaking. The main goal
of such classifiers is to improve the probability of success rather than hopelessly trying
to guarantee 100% correct classification.. </p>
    
     <em> Decision Tables Acquired From Data</em>
    
    <p>When deriving predictive models from data within rough set framework, one of the
primary constructs is a decision table (Pawlak, 1991). The decision table represents
knowledge about the domain of interest and the relation between the knowledge and the
prediction target. Some columns of the table correspond to descriptive attributes used
to classify objects of the domain of interest; other columns represent prediction targets.
The rows of the table represent the classes of the classification of the domain in terms
of the descriptive attributes. If the decision table contains representatives of all or almost
all classes of the domain, and if the relation with the prediction targets is completely or
almost completely specified, then the table can be treated as a model of the domain. Such
a model represents descriptions of all or almost all objects of the domain and their
relationship to the prediction target.<br>
        The specification of the relationship may include empirical assessments of conditional probabilities, if the VPRSM approach is used in model derivation. The model is
called a probabilistic decision table. If the model is complete enough, and if the estimates
of conditional probabilities are relatively close to real values, then the decision table can
be used as a basis of approximate classifier system. To ensure relative completeness and
generality of the decision table model, the values of the attributes used to construct the
classification of the domain need to be sufficiently general. For example, in many practical
problems, rather than using precise numeric measurements, value ranges are often used
after preliminary discretization of original precise values (Nguyen, 1998). This conversion of original data values into secondary, less precise representation is one of the major
pre-processing steps in rough set-based methodology of decision table acquisition from
data. Once the decision table has been acquired, it can be further analyzed and optimized
using classical algorithms for inter-attribute dependency computation and minimal nonredundant subset of attributes (attribute reduct) identification (Pawlak, 1991).
    </p>
    <em>Rule Generation Based on a Generalization of the Rough Set Theory
(LERS)</em>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data mining system, Learning from Examples using Rough Sets (LERS), was
developed at the University of Kansas. The first implementation of LERS was done in
Franz Lisp in 1988. The current version of LERS, implemented in C++, is a family of data
mining systems. The LERS system is universal—it may compute rules from any kind of
data. Computed rule sets may be used for classification of new cases or for interpretation
of knowledge. One potential application of rule sets is rule-based expert systems.<br>
        &emsp;The LERS system may compute rules from imperfect data (Grzymala-Busse, 1988,
1991, 1992), e.g., data with missing attribute values or inconsistent cases. LERS is also
equipped with a set of discretization schemes to deal with numerical attributes. Similarly,
a variety of LERS methods may help to handle missing attribute values. But, most
importantly, LERS accepts inconsistent input data. Two cases are inconsistent when
they are characterized by the same values of all attributes, but they belong to two different
concepts. LERS handles inconsistencies using rough set theory. For inconsistent data,
LERS computes lower and upper approximations of all concepts. The ideas of lower
and upper approximations are fundamental for rough set theory. LERS uses a different
generalization of the original rough set theory than VPRSM. Rules formed by LERS are
equipped with numbers characterizing rule quality (uncertainty). Also, LERS is assisted
with tools for rule validation: leaving-one-out, ten-fold cross validation, and hold-out.<br>
   &emsp; LERS has proven its applicability, having been used for two years by NASA
Johnson Space Center (Automation and Robotics Division), as a tool to develop expert
systems of the type most likely to be used in medical decisionmaking on board the
International Space Station. LERS was also used to enhance facility compliance under
Sections 311, 312, and 313 of Title III of the Emergency Planning and Community Right
to Know (Grzymala-Busse, 1993). That project was funded by the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The LERS system was used in other areas as well, e.g., in the medical
field to compare the effects of warming devices for postoperative patients, to assess
preterm birth (Woolery & Grzymala-Busse, 1994), and for diagnosis of melanoma
(Grzymala-Busse, Grzymala-Busse, & Hippe, 2001)
    </p>
    <em>LERS Classification System</em>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;For classification of unseen cases, the LERS system uses a “bucket brigade
algorithm” (Booker, Goldberg, & Holland, 1990; Holland, Holyoak, & Nisbett, 1986),
extended to use partial matching of rules and cases. The decision to which class a case
belongs is made on the basis of two parameters: strength and support. They are defined
as follows: Strength is the total number of cases correctly classified by the rule during
training. The second parameter, support, is defined as the sum of scores of all matching
rules from the class. As follows from experiments, partial matching is a valuable
mechanism when complete matching fails (Grzymala-Busse, 1994). In the LERS classification system, the user may use 16 strategies for classification. However, as a result
of experiments, again, it can be shown that the most successful strategy is based on
strength, support, and partial matching while ignoring specificity (number of conditions
in a rule) (Grzymala-Busse & Zou, 1998).<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;LERS equips rules with numbers characterizing quality of rules. Thus, like VPRSM,
LERS goes beyond the original rough set theory. The generalizations of the original
rough set theory represented by VPRSM and LERS are different. The prime concern of
VPRSM is forming decision tables, while LERS was designed to form rule sets. However,
all numbers related with rules and defined on the basis of VPRSM may be computed from
numbers allocated by LERS to each rule. On the other hand, the LERS classification
system uses ideas that are foreign to VPRSM, such as specificity, support, and partial
matching. Thus, the two generalizations are independent and neither can be reduced to
the other.

    <h4>Related Work</h4>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The basics of the theory are summarized in Pawlak’s book (Pawlak, 1991). He also
introduced novel theories of rough functions and rough relations, which directly apply
to the creation of approximate functional and relational models from data (Pawlak, 1996).
Since the introduction of the original RST, several extensions of the original model were
proposed (Greco, Matarazzo, Slowinski, & Stephanowski, 2000; Ziarko, 1993). In
particular, VPRSM was first published in Ziarko (1993) and was further investigated by
Beynon (2000), Kryszkiewicz (1994), and others, and served as a basis of a new approach
to inductive logic programming (Mahesvari, Siromoney, Mehata, & Inoue, 2001) . The
initial notion of a data-acquired decision table, also called an information system, is
credited to Pawlak (1991). The probabilistic decision tables were introduced by Ziarko
(1998b). The LERS system was first described in Grzymala-Busse, 1992). Its most
important algorithm, LEM2, was also presented in Chan and Grzymala-Busse(1994).
Initial versions of LERS were presented by Budihardjo, Grzymala-Busse , and Woolery
(1991), and Grzymala-Busse (1997, 1998).<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;There exists an extensive body of literature on rough set theory applications to
knowledge discovery and data mining. A comprehensive review of the state art is
available in Polkowski and Skowron (1998). A number of sources reported experiments
with using rough set theory for pattern recognition, including speech recognition,
handwriting recognition, and music fragment classification (Kostek, 1998; Plonka &
Mrozek, 1995; Zhao, 1993). The rough set theory was first applied to trainable control
by Mrozek (1986) when modeling control behavior of cement mill operators. Importantapplications of LERS were published in Freeman, Grzymala-Busse , Riffel, and Schroeder
(2001) , Grzymala-Busse et al. (2001), Grzymala-Busse and Gunn (1995), Grzymala-Busse
and Woolery (1994), Gunn and Grzymala-Busse (1994), Loupe, Freeman, Grzymala-Busse,
and Schroeder (2001), Moradi, Grzymala-Busse, and Roberts (1995), and Woolery,
Grzymala-Busse, Summers, and Budihardjio(1991). Some other rough set theory-based
control applications are reported in Peters, Skowron and Suraj (1999).

    <h4>Global Coverings</h4>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;We are assuming that the input data set is in a form of a table. Rows of the table
are called cases (or examples). Columns are labeled by attributes and a decision. An
example of such a table is presented in Table 1.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Table 1 depicts a simplified data base showing eight homeowners (cases) applying
to a bank for a loan to buy a car. Any such table defines an information function ρ that
maps the set of all ordered pairs (case, attribute) into the set of attribute values. For
example, ρ (c1, Home) is equal to expensive.
</p> <br><br><br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Table 1: Consistent data set
    <br><br>
   
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(22).png"><br><br>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;One of the fundamental ideas of rough set theory is the relation of the set of all cases
implied by a subset P of the set A of all attributes, called an indiscernibility relation, and
denoted by IND(P). For any two cases c and c', the relation indiscernibility is defined
as follows:<br><br>
        <center>(c, c') ∈ IND(P) if and only if ρ (c, a) = ρ (c', a) for all a ∈ P</center>
<br>
   &emsp; Obviously, IND(P) is an equivalence relation, so it may be represented by the
partition on U induced by IND(P). This partition will be denoted by U/IND(P). Two cases
c and c' belong to the same set of the partition U/IND(P) if and only if (c, c') ∈ IND(P).
For example,<br><br>
    <center>U/IND({Home}) = {{c1, c3, c8}, {c2, c5, c6, c7}, {c4}}<br><br>
         and<br><br>
    U/IND({Home, Boat}) = {{c1, c8}, {c2, c5}, {c3}, {c4}, {c6, c7}}.</center> 
        <br><br>
        
        &emsp;Sets belonging to the partition U/IND(P) are called P-elementary sets or blocks.
Elements c1 and c3 belong to the same {Home}-elementary set (or block) of U/ND({Home})
because the value of variable Home is the same for both c1 and c3.<br>
       &emsp; In a special case where set P contains only one variable, the decision, usually
denoted by d, the corresponding sets that constitute U/IND(P) are called concepts. In
Table 1, we distinguish two concepts: {c1, c3, c5, c7}, and {c2, c4, c6, c8}. The former
concept consists of all accepted applicants, the latter concept consists of all rejected<br>
        
       &emsp; The basic problem is how to determine a subset P of the set A describes all concepts.
In different words, our problem is whether a subset P of A is sufficient to distinguish all
concepts. For example, the single attribute {Home} is not sufficient, since Home has the
same value expensive for c1 and c8, yet c1 and c2 belong to two different concepts.
Moreover, a subset {Home, Boat} is not sufficient either, since both have the same
values for c1 and c8 (expensive, no), and c1 and c2, as observed before, belong to two
different concepts. On the other hand, the set of all attributes: {Home, Boat, Credit_Card,
Age} is sufficient, since values of all four attributes are unique for corresponding
concepts. The value vector (expensive, no, yes, old) of attribute vector (Home, Boat,
Credit_Card, Age) characterize only one case, c1, that belongs to the concept approved
loan applications. We say that {d} depends on the subset P = {Home, Boat, Credit_Card,
Age}. The necessary and sufficient condition for {d} to depend on P is<br><br>
        
        <center>U/IND(P) ≤ U/IND({d})</center>
       &emsp; The sign “≤” in the above expression concerns partitions. For partitions π and τ
on U, π ≤ τ if and only if for each block B of π there exists a block B' of τ such that B
⊆ B'. In other words, {d} depends on P if and only if every concept defined by {d} is
the union of some P-elementary sets (or blocks of U/IND(P)).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In our example,<br><br>
        <center>
        U/IND({Loan_Application}) = {{c1, c3, c5, c7}, {c2, c4, c6, c8}},
U/IND({Home, Age}) = {{c1, c3}, {c2, c6}, {c4}, {c5}, {c7}, {c8}},
            <br><br><br>so<br><br><br>
            U/IND({Home, Age} ≤ U/IND({Loan_Application}
        </center>
        <br><br>
        or, {Loan_Application depends on {Home, Age}. It is not difficult to check that U/
IND({Home, Age} ≤ U/IND({Loan_Application}: every block of U/IND({Home, Age})
is a subset of corresponding block from U/IND({Loan_Application}).<br>
       &emsp; The minimal subset P such that {d} depends on P is called a global covering of {d}.
The global covering is also called relative reduct (Pawlak, 1991). In the example in Table
1, there exist precisely two global coverings of Loan_Application: {Home, Age} and
{Home, Credit_Card, Boat}. Algorithms for finding the set of all global coverings was
published in Grzymala-Busse (1991).    
    </p>
    <center><h3>Algorithm for Finding the Set of All Global Coverings</h3></center>
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;The aim of the algorithm is to find the set C of all global coverings of {d}. The
cardinality of the set X is denoted |X|. Let k be a positive integer. The set of all subsets
of the same cardinality k of the set A is denoted Pk
, i.e., Pk
 = {{xi1, xi2,..., xik} | xi1, xi2,...,
xik ∈ A}.<br><br>
        <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(23).png">
    <br><br>
       &emsp; Time complexity of the algorithm for finding the set of all coverings of R in S is
exponential.</p><br><br>
    <h4>Local Coverings</h4>
   <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;In the definition of global covering, all involved attributes and decision are
considered globally, i.e., for all cases. Here we will introduce a local covering, definedby variable-value pairs. Let x be a variable (an attribute or a decision), and let v be a value
of x. The block of a variable-value pair (x, v), denoted [(x, v)], is the set of all elements
of the universe U that for variable x have value v. Thus, the concept is a block of [(d, w)]
for some value w of decision d. For example, in Table 1, the block of (Home, expensive)
is {c1, c3, c8}.<br>
       &emsp;Let B be a subset of the universe U. Let T be a non-empty set of attribute-value pairs,
where all involved attributes are different. The block of T, denoted [T], is defined as
       <center><br>∩ [(x, v)]. <br>(x, v) ∈ Τ</center>
       <br><br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Let B be the set {c1, c3, c5, c7}, that is, B is the block of (Loan_Application,
approved}. In the example from Table 1, let X be the set {(Home, expensive), (Boat, no)}.
The block [X] of X is equal to<br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;[(Home, expensive)] ∩ [(Boat, no)] = {c1, c3, c8} ∩ {c1, c6, c7, c8} =<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{c1, c8} ⊄ {c1, c3, c5, c7} = B.<br>
       &emsp;&emsp;Thus B = {c1, c3, c5, c7} does not depend on X. On the other hand, for Y equal to
{(Home, expensive), (Age, Old)}, the block [Y] of Y is equal to<br><br>
       &emsp;&emsp;[(Home, expensive)] ∩ [(Age, Old] = {c1, c3, c8} ∩ {c1, c2, c3, c6} =
{c1, c3} ⊆ {c1, c3, c5, c7} = B<br><br>
       so B = {c1, c3, c5, c7} depends on {(Home, expensive), (Age, Old)}.<br><br>
       
       &emsp;&emsp;We say that B depends on a set T of attribute-value pairs if and only if [T] ⊆ B. Set
T is a minimal complex of B if and only if B depends on T and no proper subset T' of T
exists such that B depends on T'.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The set Y = {(Home, expensive), (Age, Old)} is a minimal complex of B = {c1, c3, c5,
c7}, since B does not depend on any subset of Y, because<br><br>
       
     &emsp;&emsp;  [(Home, expensive)] ⊄ B<br><br>
and<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;[(Age, Old)] ⊄ B.<br><br>
       
       
    &emsp;&emsp;  However, there exist more minimal complexes of B. For example, Z = {(Home,
Middle), (Credit_Card, yes)} is another minimal complex of B, because <br><br>
    
    &emsp;&emsp; [Y] = [{(Home, Middle), (Credit_Card, yes)}] =
[(Home, Middle)] ∩ [(Credit_Card, yes)] = {c2, c5, c6, c7} ∩ {c1, c4, c5, c7} =
{c5, c7} ⊆ B,
[{(Home, Middle)] ⊄ B, and [(Credit_Card, yes)}] ⊄ B.<br><br>
     &emsp;&emsp;  Let T be a non-empty family of non-empty sets of attribute-value pairs. Set T is called
a local covering of B if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied
       
       &emsp;&emsp;(1) each member T of T is a minimal complex of B,<br>
(2) ∪[T] = B, and T ∈ T<br>
(3) T is minimal, i.e., no subset of T exists that satisfies conditions (1) and (2)<br><br>
       
       &emsp;&emsp;For the example in Table 1, the set {Y, Z}, where Y = {(Home, expensive), (Age, Old)}
and Z = {(Home, Middle), (Credit_Card, yes)} is a local covering of B = {c1, c3, c5, c7}.
The local covering is also called value reduct (Pawlak, 1991).

    <ceneter> <h3>Lower and Upper Approximations of a Set</h3></ceneter>
    
    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;Real-life data are frequently inconsistent, i.e., data that contain conflicting cases.
Two cases are conflicting when they are characterized by the same values of all attributes,
but they belong to two different concepts. For example, Table 2 presents inconsistent
data. Cases c8 and c9 are conflicting.<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;Let [x]P denote the p-elementary set of U/IND(P). Any finite union of elementary
sets of P is called a definable set by P. Let B be a concept. For inconsistent data, in
general, B is not a definable set in P. However, set B may be approximated by two definable
sets in P; the first one is called a lower approximation of B in P, denoted by PB and defined
as follows<br><br>
    
   &emsp;&emsp; {x ∈ U | [x]P ⊆ B }.<br><br><br>

    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(24).png"><br><br>
        
       &emsp;&emsp; The second set is called an upper approximation of B in P, denoted by
_
P B an
defined as follows<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;{x ∈ U | [x]P ∩ B ≠ Ø }.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The lower approximation of B in P is the greatest definable set by P, contained in
B. The upper approximation of B is the least definable set by P containing B. A rough
set of B in P is the family of all subsets of U having the same lower and the same upper
approximations of B in P.<br>
For Table 2,<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;U/IND({Loan_Application} = {{c1, c3, c5, c7, c9}, {c2, c4, c6, c8}}<br><br>
the lower approximation of B = {c1, c3, c5, c7, c9} in A= {Home, Boat, Credit_Card, Age}
is the set {{c1, c3, c5, c7}, the upper approximation of B = {c1, c3, c5, c7, c9} in A is the
set {c1, c3, c5, c7, c8, c9}, and the rough set of B in A is the set {{B}}.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For inconsistent data, lower and upper approximations of a set may be used for
defining two different kinds of set membership: certain and possible. Say that the
concept B is not definable by the subset P of the set A of all attributes. An element x ∈<br><br>
U is said to be certainly in B if and only if x ∈ P_ B. An element x ∈ U is said to be possibly<br><br>
in B if and only if x ∈
_
P B. Both definitions have straightforward interpretation. We have
to decide whether x is or is not in B on the basis of accessible information, i.e., attributes
from P. This means that we may describe the membership of x in terms of members of U/
IND(P). On the other hand, both sets, P_ B and PB are constructed from U/IND(P).
Moreover,<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;P_ B ⊆ B ⊆
_
P B,<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;so if x ∈ P_ B then x is certainly in B. However, if x ∈
_
P B, then x does not need to
be in B. If B is not definable,
_
P B – B ≠ Ø, and x may be a member of
_
P B – B and not a
member of B. Thus x is only possibly in B.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In our example, for B = {c1, c3, c5, c7, c9} and A = {Home, Boat, Credit_Card, Age},
c1 ∈ A_ B, so c1 ∈ B. However, c8 ∈
_
A B and c8 ∉ B.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;A few numbers characterizing a degree of uncertainty may be associated with a
rough set. These numbers, sometimes useful for evaluation, have limited value, because
the most important tool of rough set theory are sets—lower and upper approximations
of a given concept B, a subset of the universe U.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;There are two universal measures of uncertainty for rough sets, introduced in
Grzymala-Busse (1987) (see also Grzymala-Busse, 1991). We will assume that P is a subset
of the set A of all attributes. The first measure is called a quality of lower approximation
of B in P, denoted γB, and equal to<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;|PB_ |<br><br>
        
       &emsp;&emsp; In Pawlak (1984), γB was called simply quality of approximation of B in P. The quality
of lower approximation of B in P is the ratio of the number of all certainly classified
elements of U by attributes from P as being in B to the number of elements of U. It is a
kind of relative frequency. There exists a nice interpretation of γBin terms of evidence
theory, also called Dempster-Shafer theory (see Shafer, 1976). With this interpretation,
γBbecomes a belief function, as it was observed for the first time in Grzymala-Busse
(1987).<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;The quality of upper approximation of B in P is the ratio of the number of all possibly
classified elements of U by attribute from P as being in B to the number of elements of
U. Like the quality of lower approximation, the quality of upper approximation is also a
kind of relative frequency. It is a plausibility function of evidence theory (GrzymalaBusse, 1987).<br><br><br><br></p>
    
    <center><h3>VARIABLE PRECISION ROUGH SET MODEL
        (VPRSM)</h3></center>
    <p>
   &emsp;&emsp; One of the primary difficulties experienced when applying the rough set approach
to practical problems is the lack of consistency in data. In other words, it is quite common
that a given combination of observations is associated with two or more different
outcomes. For example, a set of symptoms observed in a patient may be linked to two
or more diseases. There exists a large body of medical knowledge on which medical
professionals base their assessment of the likelihood of correct diagnoses in such
uncertain situations. However, it is rare to be able to make conclusive diagnosis without
any uncertainty. In terms of rough set-based data analysis, it means that the relation
between symptoms and diseases is grossly non-deterministic, resulting in all or almost
all rough boundary representation of the diseases.
&emsp;&emsp;In such representation, only upper approximation-based or possible rules could be
computed from data. The possible rules associate a number of possible outcomes with
a combination of observations without providing any hints regarding the probability of
each outcome. This is not sufficient in many practical situations where the differentiation
must be made between less likely versus more likely outcomes. To deal with this problem,
the possibility of using the variable precision extension of the rough set approach was
introduced Ziarko (1993). VPRSM includes the frequency distribution information in its
basic definitions of rough set approximations, thus making the model applicable to a large
class of “inconsistent” or non-deterministic data analysis problems.
    
    </p>
    
    <br><br>
    <h4>Classification Table</h4><br>
&emsp;&emsp;As in the original rough set model, VPRSM is based on the prior knowledge of
indiscernibility relation IND(C), as defined previously. The indiscernibility relation
represents pre-existing knowledge about the universe of interest. It is expressed in terms
of identity of values of the set C of all attributes. The C-elementary sets or just
elementary sets for simplicity, of the classification so defined are the basic building
blocks from which the definable sets are constructed. They are also used to build lower
and upper approximations of any arbitrary subset X of the universe, as described
previously. In VPRSM, each C-elementary set E is additionally associated with two
measures:<br>
1. The probability P(E) of the elementary set, which is normally estimated based on
available data by
P(E) = |E|
|U|
 .<br><br>
2. The conditional probability P(X|E), which represents the likelihood of such an event
that an object belonging to the C-elementary set E would also belong to the set X.
The conditional probability P(X|E) is typically estimated by calculating the relative
degree of overlap between sets X and E, based on available data, that is
P(X|E) = |X ∩ E|.
 |E|<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, Table 3 illustrates the classification of a domain U in terms of the
attributes Home, Boat, Credit, Age, along with the specification of the conditional
probabilities with respect to a subset X, which is defined here as collection of low income
earners. The decision Income specifies the target set X characterized by Income = low.
The set X is specified by providing the estimate of the conditional probability P(X|Ei
) for
each elementary set Ei
, (i = 1, 2,..., 8).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In the above example, the classification represented in the table might have been
obtained from the analysis of millions of data records drawn from very large domain. To<br><br><br>
Table 3: Classification table<br><br>
    
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(25).png"><br><br>
    
    <p>
    conduct rough set-based analysis of such a domain in the framework of VPRSM, it is
essential to:<br>
1. Identify all feasible combinations of attributes occurring in the domain, that is, to
know identifying descriptions of all elementary sets appearing in the domain;
2. Compute close estimate of the probability P(E) for each elementary set E,; and
3. Compute close estimates of conditional probabilities P(X|Ei
) associated with
elementary sets Ei for the given target set X.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The table summarizing all this information is referred to as a classification table.
It should be noted that, in the likely absence of all feasible combinations of attributes
occurring in the domain in the classification table, all conclusions derived from the table
will only apply to a sub-domain of the domain. This sub-domain equals the union of all
known elementary sets. For example, the results of the analysis of the information
contained in Table 3 apply exclusively to the sub-domain U8 = ∪ {Ei
 : i = 1, 2,..., 8} of the
whole domain (universe) U. In what follows, for the sake of simplicity, we will assume
that the descriptions and the associated probability distributions are known for all
elementary sets of the domain U. The reader should be aware, however, that in practice
that assumption may not be satisfied.<br><br>
    <h4>Approximation Regions</h4><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The information contained in the classification table can be used to construct
generalized, rough approximations of the subset X ⊆ U. Similar to the original rough set
model definitions, the approximations are defined in terms of unions of some elementary
sets. The defining criteria are expressed here in terms of conditional probabilities rather
than in terms of relations of set inclusion and overlap. Two criteria parameters are used.
The first parameter referred to as the lower limit l represents the highest acceptable
degree of the conditional probability P(X|Ei
) to include the elementary set Ei
 in the
negative region of the set X. In other words, the l-negative region of the set X, NEGl
(X)
is defined as<br><br>
NEGl
(X) = ∪ {Ei
 : P(X|Ei
) ≤ l}.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The l-negative region of the set X is a collection of objects which, based on the
available information, cannot be classified as included in the set with the probability
higher than l. Alternatively, the l-negative region is a collection of objects about which
it can be said— with certainty greater or equal to STET— that they do not belong to the
set X.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The positive region of the set X is defined using upper limit parameter u as the
criterion. The upper limit reflects the least acceptable degree of the conditional
probability P(X|Ei
) to include the elementary set Ei
 in the positive region, or u-lower
approximation of the set X. In other words, the u-positive region of the set X, POSu(X)
is defined as<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;POSu
(X) = ∪ {Ei
 : P(X|Ei
) ≥ u}.
    <br><br>
Table 4: Probabilistic decision table
    
     <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(26).png"><br><br><br>
    
    <p>
    
    &emsp;&emsp;The u-positive region of the set X is a collection of objects which, based on the
available information, can be classified as included in the set with the probability not less
than u. Alternatively, the u-positive region is a collection of objects about which it can
be said—with certainty greater or equal to u— that they do belong to the set X.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;When defining the approximations, it is assumed that 0 ≤ l < u ≤ 1. Intuitively, l
specifies those objects in the universe U that are unlikely to belong to the set X, whereas
u specifies objects that are likely to belong to the set X . The parameters l and u associate
concrete meaning with these verbal subjective notions of probability.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The objects that are not classified as being in the u-positive region nor in the lnegative region belong to the (l, u)-boundary region of the set X, denoted as BNRl,u
(X)=
∪ {Ei : l < P(X|Ei
) < u}. This is the specification of objects about which it is known that
they are not sufficiently likely to belong to set X and also not sufficiently unlikely to not
belong to the set X. In other words, the boundary area objects cannot be classified with
sufficient certainty, as both members of the set X and members of the complement of the
set X, the set ¬X.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In Table 4, referred to as a probabilistic decision table, each elementary set Ei
 is
assigned a unique designation of its rough region with respect to set X of low-income
individuals by using l = 0.1 and u = 0.8 as the criteria. This table is derived from the
previous classification presented in Table 3.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;After assigning respective rough region to each elementary set, the resulting
decision table becomes fully deterministic with respect to the new decision Rough
Region. Consequently, the techniques of the original model of rough sets, as described
in previous sections, can be applied from now on to conduct analysis of the decision
table. In particular, they can be used to analyze dependency between attributes, to
eliminate redundant attributes, and to compute optimized rules by eliminating some
redundant values of the attributes.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    
    <h4> Analysis of Probabilistic Decision Tables</h4><br>
    <p>
&emsp;&emsp;The analysis of the probabilistic decision tables involves inter-attribute dependency analysis, identification and elimination of redundant attributes, and attribute
significance analysis (Ziarko, 1999).<br><br>
    <em>Attribute Dependency Analysis</em><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The original rough sets model-based analysis involves detection of functional, or
partial functional dependencies, and subsequent dependency-preserving reduction of
attributes. In VPRSM, (l, u)-probabilistic dependency is a subject of analysis. The (l,
u)-probabilistic dependency is a generalization of partial-functional dependency.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The (l, u)-probabilistic dependency γl,u
(C, d, v) between attributes C and the
decision d specifying the target set X of objects with the value v of the attribute d is
defined as the total probability of (l, u)-positive and (l, u)-negative approximation regions
of the set X. In other words,<br><br>
γl,u
(C, d, v) = P(POSu
(X) ∪ NEGl
(X)).<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The dependency degree can be interpreted as a measure of the probability that a
randomly occurring object will be represented by such a combination of attribute values
that the prediction of the corresponding value of the decision, or of its complement, could
be done with the acceptable confidence. That is, the prediction that the object is a member
of set X could be made with probability not less than u, and the prediction that the object
is not the member of X could be made with probability not less than 1 – l. The lower and
upper limits define acceptable probability bounds for predicting whether an object is or
is not the member of the target set X. If (l, u)-dependency is less than one, it means that
the information contained in the table is not sufficient to make either positiveor negative
prediction in some cases.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, the (0.1, 0.8)-dependency between C = {Home, Boat, Credit, Age} and
Income = low is 0.95. It means that in 95% of new cases, we will be able to make the
determination with confidence of at least 0.8 that an object is member of the set X or of
its complement U – X. In cases when the complement is decided, the decision confidence
would be at least 0.9.<br><br>
    <em>Reduction of Attributes</em><br>
&emsp;&emsp;One of the important aspects in the analysis of decision tables extracted from data
is the elimination of redundant attributes and identification of the most important
attributes. By redundant attributes, we mean any attributes that could be eliminated
without negatively affecting the dependency degree between remaining attributes and
the decision. The minimum subset of attributes preserving the dependency degree is
termed reduct. In the context of VPRSM, the original notion of reduct is generalized to
accommodate the (l, u)-probabilistic dependency among attributes. The generalized (l,
u)-reduct of attributes, REDl,u
(C, d, v) ⊆ C is defined as follows:<br><br>
1. γl,u(REDl,u
(C, d, v), d, v) ≥ γl,u(C, d, v);<br>
2. For every attribute a belonging to the reduct REDl,u
(C, d, v) the following relation
holds: γl,u(REDl,u
(C, d, v), d, v) > γl,u(REDl,u
(C, d, v) – {a}, d, v)<br><br>
    
        
       &emsp;&emsp; The first condition imposes the dependency preservation requirement according
to which the dependency between target set X and the reduct attributes should not be
less than the dependency between the target set C of all attributes.<br>
The second condition imposes the minimum size requirement according to which
no attribute can be eliminated from the reduct without reducing the degree of dependency.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, one (l, u)-reduct of attributes in Table 4 is {Home, Boat, Credit}. The
decision table reduced to these three attributes will have the same predictive accuracy
as the original Table 4. In general , a number of possible reducts can be computed, leading
to alternative minimal representations of the relationship between attributes and the
decision.<br><br>
        <em>Analysis of Significance of Condition Attributes</em><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Determination of the most important factors in a relationship between groups of
attributes is one of the objectives of factor analysis in statistics. The factor analysis is
based on strong assumptions regarding the form of probability distributions, and
therefore is not applicable to many practical problems. The theory of rough sets has
introduced a set of techniques that help in identifying the most important attributes
without any additional assumptions. These techniques are based on the concepts of
attribute significance factor and of a core set of attributes. The significance factor of
an attribute a is defined as the relative decrease of dependency between attributes and
the decision caused by the elimination of the attribute a. The core set of attributes is the
intersection of all reducts; that is, it is the set of attributes that would never be eliminated
in the process of reduct computation. Both of these definitions cannot be applied if the
nature of the practical problem excludes the presence of functional or partial functional
dependencies. However, as with other basic notions of rough set theory, they can be
generalized in the context of VPRSM to make them applicable to non-deterministic data
analysis problems. In what follows, the generalized notions of attribute significance
factor and core are defined and illustrated with examples.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The (l, u)-significance, SIGl,u
(a) of an attribute a belonging to a reduct of the
collection of attributes C can be obtained by calculating the relative degree of dependency decrease caused by the elimination of the attribute a from the reduct:<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;SIGl,u(a) = γl,u(REDl,u(C, d, v), d, v) – γl,u(REDl,u(C, d, v) – {a}, d, v)
γl,u(REDl,u(C, d, v), {a,} v)<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;For instance, the (0.1, 0.8)-dependency between reduct {Home, Boat, Credit} and
Income = low is 0.95. It can be verified that after elimination of the attribute Credit the
dependency decreases to 0.4. Consequently, the (0.1, 0.8)-significance of the attribute
Credit in the reduct {Home, Boat, Credit} is<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;0.95 – 0.4<br>
&emsp;&emsp;0.95<br><br>
Similarly, the (0.1, 0.8)-significance can be computed for other reduct attributes.<br>
     
     &emsp;&emsp;   The set of the most important attributes, that is, those that would be included in
every reduct, is called core set of attributes (Pawlak, 1982). In VPRSM, the generalized
notion of (l, u)-core has been introduced. It is defined exactly the same way as in the
original rough set model, except that the definition requires that the (l, u)-core set of
attributes be included in every (l, u)-reduct. It can be proven that the core set of attributes
COREl,u
(C, d, v), the intersection of all CLOSE UP THIS SPACE (l, u)-reducts, satisfies
the following property:<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;COREl,u
(C, d, v) = {a ∈ C : γl,u
(C, d, v) – γl,u
(C – {a}, d, v) > 0 }.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The above property leads to a simple method for calculating the core attributes. To
test whether an attribute belongs to core, the method involves temporarily eliminating
the attribute from the set of attributes and checking if dependency decreased. If
dependency did not decrease, the attribute is not in the core; otherwise, it is one of the
core attributes.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, it can be verified by using the above testing procedure that the core
attributes of the decision table given in Table 4 are Home and Boat. These attributes will
be included in all (0.1, 0.8)-reducts of the Table 4, which means that they are essential
for preservation of the prediction accuracy.<br><br>
        <em>Identification of Minimal Rules</em><br>
&emsp;&emsp;During the course of rough set-related research, considerable effort was put into
development of algorithms for computing minimal rules from decision tables. From a data
mining perspective, the rules reflect persistent data patterns representing potentially
interesting relations existing between data items. Initially, the focus of the rule
acquisition algorithms was on identification of deterministic rules, that is, rules with
unique conclusion, and possibilistic rules, that is, rules with an alternative of possible
conclusions. More recently, computation of uncertain rules with associated probabilistic certainty factors became of interest, mostly inspired by practical problems existing in
the area of data mining where deterministic data relations are rare. In particular, VPRSM
is directly applicable to computation of uncertain rules with probabilistic confidence
factors. The computation of uncertain rules in VPRSM is essentially using standard
rough-set methodology and algorithms involving computation of global coverings, local
coverings, or decision matrices (Ziarko & Shan, 1996). The major difference is in the
earlier steps of bringing the set of data to the probabilistic decision table form, as
described earlier in this chapter. The probabilistic decision table provides an input to
the rule computation algorithm. It also provides necessary probabilistic information to
associate conditional probability estimates and rule probability estimates with the
computed rules.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, based on the probabilistic decision table given in Table 4, one can
identify the deterministic rules by using standard rough-set techniques (see Figure 1).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Based on the probabilistic information contained in Table 4, one can associate
probabilities and conditional probabilities with the rules. Also, the rough region
designations can be translated to reflect the real meaning of the decision, in this case
Income = low. The resulting uncertain rules are presented in Figure 2.<br><br>    
    </p>
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(27).png"><br><br>
    
   &emsp;&emsp;All of the above rules have their conditional probabilities within the acceptability
limits, as expressed by the parameters l = 0.1 and u = 0.8. The rules for the boundary area
are not shown here since they do not meet the acceptability criteria.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Some algorithms for rule acquisition within the framework of VPRSM have been
implemented in the commercial system DataLogic and in the system KDD-R (Ziarko,
1998b). A comprehensive new system incorporating the newest developments in the
rough set area is currently being implemented.<br><br><br>
    <h3>DATA MINING SYSTEM LERS</h3>
&emsp;&emsp;The rule induction system, called Learning from Examples using Rough Sets (LERS),
was developed at the University of Kansas. The first implementation of LERS was done
in Franz Lisp in 1988.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The current version of LERS, implemented in C and C++, contains a variety of datamining tools. LERS is equipped with the set of discretization algorithms to deal with
numerical attributes. Discretization is an art rather than a science, so many methods
should be tried for a specific data set. Similarly, a variety of methods may help to handle
missing attribute values. On the other hand, LERS has a unique way to work with
inconsistent data, following rough set theory. If a data set is inconsistent, LERS will
always compute lower and upper approximations for every concept, and then will
compute certain and possible rules, respectively.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The user of the LERS system may use four main methods of rule induction: two
methods of machine learning from examples (called LEM1 and LEM2; LEM stands for
Learning from Examples Module) and two methods of knowledge acquisition (called All<br><br>
    
 <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(28).png"><br><br>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 Global Coverings and All Rules). Two of these methods are global (LEM1 and All Global
Coverings); the remaining two are local (LEM2 and All Rules).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input data file is presented to LERS in the form illustrated in Table 5. In this table,
the first line (any line does not need to be one physical line—it may contain a few physical
lines) contains declaration of variables: a stands for an attribute, d for decision, x means
“ignore this variable.” The list of these symbols starts with “<” and ends with “>”. The
second line contains declaration of the names of all variables, attributes, and decisions,
surrounded by brackets. The following lines contain values of all variables.<br>
    <h4>LEM1—Single Global Covering</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;In this option, LERS may or may not take into account priorities associated with
attributes and provided by the user. For example, in a medical domain, some tests
(attributes) may be dangerous for a patient. Also, some tests may be very expensive,
while—at the same time—the same decision may be made using less expensive tests.
LERS computes a single global covering using the following algorithm:<br><br>
Algorithm SINGLE GLOBAL COVERING<br>
Input: A decision table with set A of all attributes and decision d;<br>
Output: a single global covering R;<br>
begin<br>
compute partition U/IND(A);<br>
P : = A;<br>
R := Ø;<br>
    
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(29).png">
    
    </”>
    
    
    <br><br>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The above algorithm is heuristic, and there is no guarantee that the computed global
covering is the simplest. However, the problem of looking for all global coverings—in
order to select the best one—is of exponential complexity in the worst case. LERS
computes all global coverings in another option, described below. The option of
computing of all global coverings is feasible for small input data files and when it is
required to compute as many rules as possible. After computing a single global covering,
LEM1 computes rules directly from the covering using a technique called dropping
conditions (i.e., simplifying rules).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For data from Table 1 (this table is consistent), the rule set computed by LEM1 is
presented in Figure 3. CLOSE UP THIS SPACE.Note that rules computed by LERS are
preceded by three numbers: specificity, strength, and the total number of training cases
matching the left-hand side of the rule. These parameters are defined previously.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The LEM1 applied to data from Table 2 (this table is inconsistent) computed the rule
set presented in Figure 4.

    <h3>LEM2—Single Local Covering</h3><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Like in LEM1 (single global covering option of LERS), in the option LEM2 (single
local covering), the user may take into account attribute priorities. In LEM2 option, LERS
uses the following algorithm for computing a single local covering:<br>

    &emsp;&emsp;Like the LEM1 option, the above algorithm is heuristic. The choice of used criteria
was found as a result of many experiments (Grzymala-Busse & Werbrouck, 1998). Rules
are eventually computed directly from the local covering, no further simplification (as in
LEM1) is required. For Table 1, LEM2 computed the rule set presented in Figure 5.<br>
    <h4>All Global Coverings</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;The All Global Coverings option of LERS represents a knowledge acquisition
approach to rule induction. LERS attempts to compute all global coverings, and then all
minimal rules are computed by dropping conditions. The following algorithm is used:<br><br>
Figure 5: Rule set computed by LEM 2.2, 2, 2.<br>
    
    
    
    
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(33).png"><br>
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(34).png"><br>
    
    
    
    &emsp;&emsp;As we observed before, the time complexity for the problem of determining all global
coverings (in the worst case) is exponential. However, there are cases when it is
necessary to compute rules from all global coverings (Grzymala-Busse & GrzymalaBusse, 1994). Hence, the user has an option to fix the value of a LERS parameter, reducing
in this fashion the size of global coverings (due to this restriction, only global coverings
of the size not exceeding this number are computed).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, from Table 1, the rule set computed by All Global Coverings option of
LERS is presented in Figure 6.<br><br>
    <h4>All Rules</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;Yet another knowledge acquisition option of LERS is called All Rules. It is the oldest
component of LERS, introduced at the very beginning in 1988. The name is justified by<br><br>
Figure 7: Rule set computed by All Rules option of LERS<br><br>
    
    <img class="img1" src="Screenshot%20(36).png"><br><br>
    
    
  &emsp;&emsp;  the way LERS works when this option is invoked: all rules that can be computed from the
decision table are computed, all in their simplest form. The algorithm takes each example
from the decision table and computes all potential rules (in their simplest form) that will
cover the example and not cover any example from other concepts. Duplicate rules are
deleted. For Table 1, this option computed the rule et presented in Figure 7.<br><br>
    <h4>Classification</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;In LERS, the first classification system to classify unseen cases using a rule set
computed from training cases was used in the system, Expert System for Environmental
Protection (ESEP). This classification system was much improved in 1994 by using a
modified version of the bucket brigade algorithm (Booker et al., 1990; Holland et al.,
1986). In this approach, the decision to which concept an example belongs is made using
three factors: strength, specificity, and support. They are defined as follows: Strength
factor is a measure of how well the rule has performed during training. Specificity is
the total number of attribute-value pairs on the left-hand side of the rule. The third factor,
support, is related to a concept and is defined as the sum of scores of all matching rules
from the concept. The concept getting the largest support wins the contest.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In LERS, the strength factor is adjusted to be the strength of a rule, i.e., the total
number of examples correctly classified by the rule during training. The concept C for
which support, i.e., the following expression<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Σ
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;matching rules R describing C
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Strength factor(R) ∗ Specificity(R)<br><br>
is the largest is a winner, and the example is classified as being a member of C.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;If an example is not completely matched by any rule, some classification systems
use partial matching. System AQ15, during partial matching, uses a probabilistic sum
of all measures of fit for rules (Michalski et al., 1986).v
&emsp;&emsp;In the original bucket brigade algorithm, partial matching is not considered a viable
alternative of complete matching. Bucket brigade algorithm depends instead on default
hierarchy (Holland et al., 1986).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In LERS, partial matching does not rely on the user’s input. If complete matching
is impossible, all partially matching rules are identified. These are rules with at least one
attribute-value pair matching the corresponding attribute-value pair of an example.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For any partially matching rule R, the additional factor, called Matching factor (R),
is computed. Matching factor(R) is defined as the ratio of the number of matched
attribute-value pairs of a rule R with the case to the total number of attribute-value pairs
of the rule R. In partial matching, the concept C for which the following expression is the
largest<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Σ
&emsp;&emsp;partially matching rules R describing C
 &emsp;&emsp;Matching factor(R) ∗ Strength factor(R) ∗ Specificity(R)<br><br>
is the winner, and the example is classified as being a member of C.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;LERS assigns three numbers to each rule: specificity, strength, and the total number
of training cases matching the left-hand side of the rule. These numbers, used during
    
    <br>
    
    
    classification, are essential for the LERS generalization of the original rough set theory.
Note that both rule parameters used in VPRSM, probability and conditional probability,
may be computed from the three numbers supplied by LERS to each rule. The probability,
used in VPRSM, is the ratio of the third number (the total number of training cases
matching the left-hand side of the rule) to the total number of cases in the data set. The
conditional probability from VPRSM is the ratio of the second number (strength) to the
third number (the total number of training cases matching the left-hand side of the rule). <br> <br> <br>
    <center><h3>APPLICATIONS</h3></center>
&emsp;&emsp;LERS has been used in the medical field, nursing, global warming, environmental
protection, natural language, and data transmission. LERS may process big datasets and
frequently outperforms not only other rule induction systems but also human experts. <br> <br>
    <h4>Medical Field</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;In the medical field, LERS was used for prediction of preterm birth, for diagnosis of
melanoma, for prediction of behavior under mental retardation, and for analysis of animal
models for prediction of self-injurious behavior. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Predicting which pregnant woman is at risk for giving birth prematurely is a difficult
problem in health care. Medical science and research has not offered viable solutions
for the prematurity problem. In one of our projects, completed in 1992-93, three large
prenatal databases were acquired. Each database was divided in two halves—50% for
training data and 50% for testing data. Each data set was then analyzed using statistical
and data-mining programs. The best predictive accuracy was accomplished using LERS.
Manual methods of assessing preterm birth have a positive predictive value of 17-38%.
The data-mining methods based on LERS reached a positive predictive value of 59-92%. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Another project was associated with melanoma diagnosis based on the well-known
ABCD formula. Our main objective was to check whether the original ABCD formula is
optimal. As a result of more than 20,000 experiments, the optimal ABCD formula was
found, reducing thus the error rate from 10.21% (original ABCD formula) to 6.04%
(optimal ABCD formula). <br>
&emsp;&emsp;In yet another project, data on heart rate were linked to environmental and
behavioral data coded from videotapes of one adult subject diagnosed with severe
mental retardation who engaged in problem behavior. The results of the analysis suggest
that using the LERS system will be a valuable strategy for exploring large data sets that
include heart rate, environmental, and behavioral measures. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Similarly, LERS was used for prediction of animal models based on their behavioral
responsiveness to a dopamine agonist, GBR12909. The three animal groups received five
injections of GBR12909 and were observed for stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors
immediately following the injections and six hours after injections. Differences in the rule
sets computed for each group enabled the prediction of the stereotyped behaviors that
may occur prior to occurrence of self-injurious behavior. <br>
    
    
   &emsp;&emsp; Also, LERS has been used by the NASA Johnson Space Center as a tool to develop
an expert system that may be used in medical decisionmaking on board the International
Space Station. <br> <br>
    <h4>Natural Language</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;One of our projects was to derive data associated with the word concept from the
Oxford English Dictionary and then place additional terms in Roget’s Thesaurus. Two
rule sets were computed from training data, using algorithms LEM2 and All-Rules of
LERS, respectively. Both rule sets were validated by testing data. The rule set computed
by the All-Rules algorithm was much better than the rule set computed by LEM2
algorithm. This conclusion is yet another endorsement of the claim that the knowledge
acquisition approach is better for rule induction than the machine-learning approach. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Another project in this area was a data-mining experiment for determining parts of
speech from a file containing the last three characters of words from the entire Roget’s
Thesaurus. Every entry was classified as belonging to one of five parts of speech: nouns,
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. The file had 129,797 entries. Only a small
portion of the file (4.82%) was consistent. LEM2 algorithm of LERS computed 836 certain
rules and 2,294 possible rules. Since the file was created from the entire Roget’s
Thesaurus, the same file was used for training and testing. The final error rate was equal
to 26.71%, with the following partial error rates: 11.75% for nouns, 73.58% for verbs,
11.99% for adverbs, 33.50% for adjectives, and 85.76% for prepositions. <br> <br> <br>
    <center> <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3></center>
&emsp;&emsp;This chapter presents two approaches to data mining based on rough sets. In both
cases generalizations of the original rough set theory are used. The first one, called
VPRSM, may be used, for example, to acquire decision tables. The second approach,
exemplified by LERS, is used for rule generation. Formed rules may be used for
classification of new, unseen cases or for interpretation of regularities hidden in the input
data. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;When VPRSM is used for the generation of decision tables, global computations
are involved, i.e., all attributes are taken into account in operations such as reducing the
attribute set or analysis of significance of attributes. On the other hand, LERS usually
uses a local approach. Computations in LERS involve attribute-value pairs rather than
entire attributes, since the main task is to form rules containing attribute-value pairs. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Data mining based on rough set theory or, more exactly, on generalizations of rough
set theory, were successfully used for more than a decade. A number of real-life projects,
listed in this chapter, confirmed viability of data mining based on rough set theory.
